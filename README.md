## Overview

This is my first challenge of Frontend Mentro, I don't speak English very well but I am try it. This challenge is was very hard to my because I start to learn web design sice 1 month ago so I am a noun. I didn't make a responsive web because I don't know it.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

My first process was to layout the HTML and after read the readme files.
The second process was see the design photos and start to code my CSS.
My last process was adjunts some errors from HTML and CSS and writing this readme-template.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

I learned a few things, one of they is how center one container, but I know how do this practice of frontend Mentor, I just found the CSS a little complicated.

### Continued development

I want to learn more of HTML because I feel that my code is not complete in this section, HTML is an important section of web design.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/espanol/news/como-centrar-un-div-con-css-10-maneras-diferentes/) - This is the only sited that I used to guide me. Is free code camp but in spanish because I don't speak English very well.
